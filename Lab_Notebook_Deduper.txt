The goal of the Deduper assignment is to remove PCR duplicates from a .sam file

What is concidered a PCR duplicate?
Reads that have the same UMI, chromosome number, strand directionality, leftmost position

1. UMI is parced out from the sequence information (1st column)

2. Chromosome number is column 3. I presorted the sam file before processing with:
samtools sort -o --no-PG <file name to write> <file name to process>

3. Strand directionality can be determined from the bitwisw flag. If position 16 in the bitwise flag
is true, the strand is negative

4. Leftmost position is determined by adjastment depending on strand directionality and soft-clipping
if needed. 

Soft clipping if present is always placed either as a first element of cigar string, last or both
(never in the middle of cigar)
If the strand is forward and leftmost soft clipping new leftmost position = old position - soft clipping number(S)

If the strand is negative new leftmost position = old position + number of rightmost soft clipping(s) +
+ number of matches(M), deletions(D), skipped regions from reference(N)

Main stats I obtained:
# header lines 64
# uniq reads 13719048
# wrong UMIs 0
# dups removed 4467362

Additionally, my script generates a summary files with the main statistics and information per 
chromosome.

1. Sort .sam file by chromosome number
    1.1 samtools view -H <file_name>.sam > header. sam separate the header of the file and save in a new file
    1.2 samtools view -F 4 <file_name>.sam > alignments.sam separate the alignments and save in a new file
    1.3 sort -k3,3 -k4,4n alignments.sam > sorted_alignments.sam
    sort -k3,3 -k4,4n alignments.sam > sorted_sequences_C1_PE_uniqAligned.sam
    grep -v '^@' Dataset1.sam | grep -E '\s[3]\s'
